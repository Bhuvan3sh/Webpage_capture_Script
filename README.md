# web_capture
<h1>Python Based project for capturing screenshots of web-pages using a script.</h1>
The primary goal for developing this script is to take screenshots from the OpenSourceMaps website and save them as Images in the desired location.<p>
To utilise this Script to generate the output images the cordinates are to be mentioned in the ymal file. I have already mentioned some of the universities in the ymal file as sample.
Change the location for the directory where you desire to save the images.

Before entering the coordinates in the ymal file you need to remember that the resoultion of the output image should be nearly equal to the imaginary points chosen on the map at zoom of your choice, and you need to take the staring and ending coordinates from the url. The 4 points that are chosen from the map play an importent role in producing the output images. *You need to only enter the digonal coordinates and the coordinates of the all 4 corners*.
The script will then produce output for as many images from the given coordinates based on the specified resoultion.


Modification on the script can be made by forking. Please drop a mail for any clarification.
